\title{Allocation rules for minimum cost spanning tree problem}
\usage{
mstRules(nodes, arcs, rule, algorithm = "Kruskal", show.data = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{vector containing the nodes of the graph, identified by a 
number that goes from \eqn{1} to the order of the graph.}

\item{arcs}{matrix with the list of arcs of the graph. Each row represents
one arc. The first two columns contain the two endpoints of each arc and the
third column contains their weights.}

\item{rule}{denotes the chosen allocation rule: "Bird", "Dutta-Kar", "Kar"
or "ERO".}

\item{algorithm}{denotes the algorithm used with the ERO rule: "Kruskal".}

\item{show.data}{logical value indicating if the function displays the 
console output\code{TRUE} or no \code{FALSE}. The deafult is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\code{mstRules} returns a matrix with the agents and the cost
that each one of them has to pay. It also prints the result in console.
}
\description{
Given a graph with at least one minimum cost spanning tree, the
\code{mstRules} function divides the cost of the tree among the agents
according to the most known rules: "Bird", "Dutta-Kar", "Kar", "ERO".
}
\examples{
# Graph
nodes <- 1:4
arcs <- matrix(c(1,2,6, 1,3,10, 1,4,6, 2,3,4, 2,4,6, 3,4,4), 
               byrow = TRUE, ncol = 3)
# Allocation Rules
mstRules(nodes, arcs, rule = "Bird")
mstRules(nodes, arcs, rule = "Dutta-Kar")
mstRules(nodes, arcs, rule = "Kar")
mstRules(nodes, arcs, rule = "ERO", algorithm = "Kruskal")
