\title{Cooperative games from minimum cost spanning tree problems}
\usage{
mstGames(nodes, arcs, game, show.data = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{vector containing the nodes of the graph, identified by a 
number that goes from \eqn{1} to the order of the graph.}

\item{arcs}{matrix with the list of arcs of the graph. Each row represents
one arc. The first two columns contain the two endpoints of each arc and the
third column contains their weights.}

\item{game}{denotes the game that we want to obtain: "pessimistic" or 
"optimistic".}

\item{show.data}{logical value indicating if the function displays the 
console output (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). By default its value is
\code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\code{mstGames} returns a vector with the characteristic fuction of
the selected game associated with the graph and prints the result in
console.
}
\description{
Given a graph with at least one minimum cost spanning tree,
\code{mstGames} builds both cooperative games: the pessimistic and the
optimistic game.

The pessimistic game associated with a minimum cost spanning
tree problem is a cooperative game in which every coalition of agents
obtains the minimum cost assuming that the agents outside the coalition
are not connected.

The optimistic game associated with with a minimum cost spanning tree
problem is a cooperative game in which every coalition of agents obtains
the minimum cost assuming that that the agents outside the coalition
are connected. Thus, the agents in the coalition can benefit from their
connections to the source
