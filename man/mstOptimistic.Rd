\title{Optimistic game of a minimum cost spanning tree problem}
\usage{
mstOptimistic(nodes, arcs)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{vector containing the nodes of the graph, identified by a 
number that goes from \eqn{1} to the order of the graph.}

\item{arcs}{matrix with the list of arcs of the graph. Each row represents
one arc. The first two columns contain the two endpoints of each arc and the
third column contains their weights.}
}
\value{
\code{mstOptimistic} returns a vector with the characteristic
function of the optimistic game.
}
\description{
Given a graph with at least one minimum cost spanning tree, the
\code{mstOptimistic} function builds the optimistic game associated with it.
}
\examples{
# Graph
nodes <- 1:4
arcs <- matrix(c(1,2,6, 1,3,10, 1,4,6, 2,3,4, 2,4,6, 3,4,4), 
               byrow = TRUE, ncol = 3)
# Optimistic game
mstOptimistic(nodes, arcs)
