#' Cooperative games from minimum cost spanning tree problems
#' 
#' @description Given a graph with at least one minimum cost spanning tree,
#' \code{mstGames} builds both cooperative games: the pessimistic and the
#' optimistic game.
#' 
#' The pessimistic game associated with a minimum cost spanning
#' tree problem is a cooperative game in which every coalition of agents
#' obtains the minimum cost assuming that the agents outside the coalition
#' are not connected.
#' 
#' The optimistic game associated with with a minimum cost spanning tree
#' problem is a cooperative game in which every coalition of agents obtains
#' the minimum cost assuming that that the agents outside the coalition
#' are connected. Thus, the agents in the coalition can benefit from their
#' connections to the source
#' 
#' @param nodes vector containing the nodes of the graph, identified by a 
#' number that goes from \eqn{1} to the order of the graph.
#' @param arcs matrix with the list of arcs of the graph. Each row represents
#' one arc. The first two columns contain the two endpoints of each arc and the
#' third column contains their weights.
#' @param game denotes the game that we want to obtain: "pessimistic" or 
#' "optimistic".
#' @param show.data logical value indicating if the function displays the 
#' console output (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). By default its value is
#' \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' @return \code{mstGames} returns a vector with the characteristic fuction of
#' the selected game associated with the graph and prints the result in
#' console.
